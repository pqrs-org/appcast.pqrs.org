    - Added an "Add your own rule using JavaScript" button to the complex modifications viewer.
    - Added an "Open in external editor" button to the complex modifications editor.
    - Added a "Clear user variables" button to EventViewer. (Thanks to @BarakXYZ)

- 🐛 Bug Fixes
    - Fixed an issue where reordering in Complex Modifications and Profiles didn't work properly when dragging while scrolling.
