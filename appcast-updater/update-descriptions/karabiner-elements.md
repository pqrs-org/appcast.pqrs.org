-   üîî Important Notes
    -   A unique random ID called `karabiner_machine_identifier` is now generated during installation.
        This ID is used for machine-specific settings and may be included in the karabiner.json file.
        If you are sharing karabiner.json with others, you might be interested in how this ID is generated and whether it is safe to share.
        Since it is a safe ID to share with others, and there is no need to mask it when you share karabiner.json with others.
        For more details, please refer to the [Privacy](https://karabiner-elements.pqrs.org/docs/privacy/) page.
