-   üí• Breaking changes
    -   The implicit conversion feature for fn+arrow keys, fn+return, and fn+delete has been removed.
        For example, fn+up arrow used to be automatically changed to page up, but it will now be treated as fn+up arrow without modification.
    -   To improve the behavior around the fn key, the Vendor ID and Product ID of the virtual keyboard used by Karabiner-Elements have been changed to the same values as those of a real Apple external keyboard.
    -   There were two JSON files that output information about connected devices, but this information has now been consolidated into `karabiner_grabber_devices.json`.
        `karabiner_grabber_device_details.json` is no longer used. Please use `karabiner_grabber_devices.json` from now on.
        -   `karabiner_grabber_devices.json`
        -   `karabiner_grabber_device_details.json` (obsoleted)
